# MitClimbingWallPollingScript

This script runs in google scripts using a google sheet as a db, which means it is free to run with a gmail account

To Run:
1. Save BoulderingWallPoll.gs to google scripts
2. give your script Gmail API and Google Sheets API permissions (editing file => resources => advanced google services)
3. create a new trigger on BoulderingWallPoll.gs "run" function which runs every 5 minutes (editing file => edit => current project's triggers => add new trigger)
